    title: "This one React mistake cost me 3 days of debugging üò≠",
    linkedinPost: "Last week, I spent 3 days debugging a React app that kept crashing randomly. The culprit? A seemingly innocent useEffect hook.\n\nI was fetching data inside useEffect without proper cleanup. Every time the component re-rendered, a new API call fired. Within minutes, I had hundreds of pending requests, memory leaks, and a frozen browser.\n\nThe fix? One line: a cleanup function.\n\nLesson learned: Always clean up your side effects. Return a cleanup function in useEffect, especially when dealing with subscriptions, timers, or API calls.\n\nThis small habit has saved me countless hours since. Don't let React's flexibility fool you ‚Äî discipline in your hooks will make or break your app's stability.",

    linkedinPost: "Want to know the secret to attracting high-paying clients as a frontend developer?\n\nIt's not about being the best coder. It's about being the best communicator.\n\nI learned this the hard way. For years, I focused solely on technical skills ‚Äî mastering React, perfecting my CSS, learning the latest frameworks. But clients kept choosing developers with half my skills.\n\nWhy? Because they could explain things clearly. They understood business goals, not just code.\n\nNow, I spend as much time learning how to present my work as I do building it. I create case studies, explain ROI, and speak in outcomes, not features.\n\nResult? My client rate tripled in 6 months.\n\nTechnical skills get you in the door. Communication skills get you the contract.",
